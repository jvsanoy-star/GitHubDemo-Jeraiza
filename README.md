What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
- I experienced difficulty in finding the version control system window, and had trouble following the step by step guide. To overcome this challenges, I decided to search a more elaborate tutorial with visuals of where to find these buttons and using trial and error to explore different buttons.
How can cloud hosting make your project more useful to others?
- Cloud hosting allows others to easily access the files they need from my project with ease no matter where they are or how far they are as long as they have internet access and an electronic device. Rather than having to access it from one device only, cloud hosting also saves time and effort to share files from my project.
